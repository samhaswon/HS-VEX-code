# HS-VEX-code
 A collection of all of the code I write for the VEX Robotics club in High School

## A word
 This repo shows where I came from with coding. At the start I hardly knew anything besides Scratch and a little Python (which I was teaching myself concurrently). Starting in C with RobotC, I learned the basics of robot programming (and how important semi colons can be). After some experience, VEX moved from the EDR platform to the V5 platform. This moved the syntax from C to C++. Generally, the mode I used in VexCode/VexCode Pro V5 was the standard mode, but I changed a few things in the header files with notepad. Over time, I slowly got better with programming in C++. I even did some work with Computer Vision as showcased in [Vision Test](V5%20Code/Vision%20Test.vex). Later, VEX introduced the drivetrain configuration feature. This helped make later autonomous routines more repeatable, but still not 100% so. Overall, this program taught me the foundational skills in programming that made AP Computer Science and my college classes much easier. Hopefully, by publishing this repository, I can help someone else accelerate their journey to success. Good luck this season!

 ## Files included
 ### RobotC Code
 Files included in the [RobotC Code](RobotC%20Code) folder contain RobotC Code... who would have guessed it. This code is for the EDR platform and is more useful for looking in retrospect that anything else. 
 ### V5 Code
 Files included in [V5 Code](V5%20Code) are from the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 games. The Programming log is only from the latter and was mostly for the engineering notebook later. There are also two different types of projects here: Vexcode and Vexcode Pro V5. Both will work in the [Vexcode Pro V5](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/install/v5) application as of writing, but are opened using "Import"[^1] and "Open" (after zipping[^2]) respectively. Lets just say there were quite a lot of changes happening as I was programming on the V5 platform.

 [^2]: The code had been unzipped to be viewable on GitHub with the exception of the programming logs
