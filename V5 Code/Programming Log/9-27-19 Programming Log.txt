- Last week or so was just fruitless research, but figured out how to get the WiFi to work
	* Turn it on in the brain, then connect, then go to 192.168.1.1

- changed the polling rate of the brain to the vision sensor from 20Hz to 10Hz.
	* This fixed the issue I have been having with the program not starting
	* Still has the green light, which apparently just means it is in use by the Brain
	* Without bot, the routine for a picked up cube did not initiate due to cube size (win)
