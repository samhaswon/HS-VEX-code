Autonomous Day!

- Goal: 2-3 points

- Part 1: go forward and grab cube
	~ just made to robot go forward with the intake on
	~ rotate afterwards
	~ went too far
	~ reduced the rotational amount

- Part 2: grab the two cubes in a row
	~ The nearest cube was rotated in place
	~ minor adjustments = cube
	~ Came up short
	~ added more time plus rotation into goal
	~ came short 3 times
	~ stacked cubes manually and timed it (overshot)
	~ back up unsuccessful - intake interference
	~ fixed the intake interference - Success

- informed Sean of how to set up the robot and how close it needs to be

- After repeated Autonomous runs, we realized that expansion just works with the flow
