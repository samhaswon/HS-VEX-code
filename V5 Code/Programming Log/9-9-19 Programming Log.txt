- started programming the vision sensor

- watched a video tutorial from a series on moving from ROBOTC to Vex Coding Studio

- started training the sensor
	* Training was not saving
	* After much searching without finding a solution, I tried not pressing the freeze button and just holding the sensor and drawing a box around the cube. This oddly worked.

- The Brain crashed around 13 or 14 times while attempting all of this
	* No true solution found after much resarch on this
		~ Most V5 users I found in forums just rebooted their Brains when they crashed

- As the day went on, I had to use supplementary lighting in order for the camera to have suffecient lighting to differientiate the cubes from the visual noise

- I tried a clawbot program to see if it would crash and after five minutes of fooling around the brain crashed when I tried to exit the program

- Finally got the vision sensor to recognize a dominate color and make a motor spin a different direction

- Conclusions: V5 brains are harder to figure out than most women, and vision sensors are cool.
